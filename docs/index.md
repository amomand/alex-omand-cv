## **Profile**

An experienced Software Engineering Manager with a strong technical foundation, specialising in platform engineering and developer experience. I lead engineering teams building shared internal platforms that improve delivery, reliability, and developer effectiveness at scale.

My background includes significant tenure in technical product leadership, giving me a well-developed product mindset that complements my engineering role. I am comfortable operating at the intersection of people leadership, technical direction, and delivery, ensuring teams are supported, focused, and aligned on outcomes that matter.

I take an analytical, data-led approach to decision-making and technical prioritisation, balancing short-term delivery with long-term platform health. I place a strong emphasis on coaching, mentorship, and creating an inclusive, high-trust environment where engineers can do their best work and grow their careers.
